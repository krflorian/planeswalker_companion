# TODOs: 
- separate rules questions from deck building questions via langchain agentss
- add rules from rulebook to context via vector search 
- update scryfall card data + rulings automatically at start of application
- card identities should stay the same in the whole text example: Anje Falkenrath should stay and not change to Anje, Maid of Dishonor
- more controll in app.py - should be able to control all parameters and behavior from there
