Then state-based actions are checked, Serra Ascendant will be a 6/6 and neither creature will die.\n",

Lifelink as a keyword was introduced in Future Sight, though the ability had previously existed on numerous cards, with rules errata retroactively changing these to lifelink.  Cards with similar abilities were not changed in this way.  Lifelink was a triggered ability when it was issued but is now a static ability due to the Magic 2010 rules changes.  (Cards that previously had a lifelink-like ability have been issued further errata to return them to their original functionality.  The lone exception to this is the Mirrodin card Loxodon Warhammer, which, since it was reprinted in Tenth Edition with the lifelink keyword, retains that rather than the original functionality on all editions).  Lifelink is found mostly on white cards, and also on black cards.\n",
