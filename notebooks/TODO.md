# TODOs: 
- write readme with chat examples and good practices
- card identities should stay the same in the whole text example: Anje Falkenrath should stay and not change to Anje, Maid of Dishonor
- speed up matching process by extracting entities first and then scanning only the entities. 
- add rules from rulebook to context via vector search
