    Deep Forest Hermit - This is a creature that creates Squirrel tokens when it enters the battlefield. It's a green card that fits into Chatterfangâ€™s color identity and synergizes with its ability to double token creation.

    Doubling Season - This is a powerful enchantment that doubles the number of tokens and counters you create. It works incredibly well with Chatterfang's ability to create additional Squirrel tokens.

    Pitiless Plunderer - A creature that can generate additional resources when your creatures die. Since Chatterfang has an ability that requires sacrificing Squirrels, this can provide you with valuable ramp and fixing.

    These cards would all support the token and sacrifice themes in a Chatterfang deck, providing you with both an army of creatures and the resources to utilize Chatterfang's abilities to their fullest. Remember to adjust the deck to your playstyle and the rest of your deck's strategy.""",

        First, you must assign lethal damage to all blockers. In this case, the 1/1 creature blocking the Aggressive Mammoth will be assigned 1 damage, because that is enough to destroy the 1/1 creature (since it is considered lethal damage to a creature with only 1 toughness).
        Then, because Aggressive Mammoth has trample, any remaining damage can be assigned to the defending player or planeswalker that the Mammoth was attacking. Since the Mammoth has 8 power and you are assigning 1 damage to the blocker, the remaining 7 damage goes through to the player or planeswalker.
        Thus, the 1/1 creature would be destroyed, your opponent would take 7 damage, and the Aggressive Mammoth would survive the combat (assuming no other effects, abilities, or damage prevention methods are applied).""",
